## 📌 Overview

PiLiquidity is an open-source project designed to support the Pi Network economy through a Community-Driven Liquidity Pool (CDLP) model. It enables users to contribute to liquidity using a non-custodial Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy while promoting real-world utility through merchant adoption and community governance.
